[Work in progress]

SoundBox manages a bunch of sound clips. Load them up front, then tell the
SoudBox which clip to play, at what position and volume. The clip will loop
by default, but it can loop any smaller part of it too.

Each clip can only be played once at a time. To play the same sound multiple
times with overlap you need to load the sound bit as multiple clips.

Supports PCM in 8-bit, 16-bit, mono, stereo.
Support for sampling rates (and 8-bit) varies by device.
Samsung Galaxy S cracks at 48kHz.
